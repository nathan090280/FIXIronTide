mobile tweaks 

make pins draggable

x preset the debug

x island should be collidable

x pin hand not working

ship sinks when 3 hulls sections 100%

x fleet 2 and 3 need the degrees put back on their compass.

x the Fleet 2 Gunnery and Fleet 3 Gunnery buttons should TOGGLE ON AND OFF

x clicking on a fleet and toggling gunnery on should bring up that fleet leaders target circle, distinct from the fleet one target circle

x fleet 2 and 3 need their turret lines to go green when aligned and firing

x fleet 1 has fire button AUTO on, i dont want that, i want to press fire myself

# Zooming System (Committed Design)

This document captures the zooming system currently implemented so it can be restored or referenced later.

## Summary
- Zoom control is a vertical slider drawn on the canvas at the top-left.
- The slider value controls ONLY the ship and turret sizes (no map at the moment).
- The slider range and labels:
  - Top label: IN (max size)
  - Bottom label: OUT (min size)
  - Range: value ‚àà [0.25, 2.5]
    - IN (top): 2.5√ó (max zoom-in for detail)
    - OUT (bottom): 0.25√ó (4√ó smaller than base)
- Turrets scale proportionally with the ship at 17.5% of hull width, and outer turrets (IDs 3,5) are offset outward by 5px.

## Implementation
- File: `compass.js`
- Key symbols and sections:
  - Slider state and helpers (near compass layout):
    - `zoomOutSlider = { x: 16, y: 16, w: 22, h: 160, dragging: false, min: 0.25, max: 2.5, value: 1.0 }`
    - `setZoomOutFromPos(py)`
    - `sliderPosFromZoomOut()`
    - `drawZoomOutSlider()`
    - `hitZoomOutSlider(px, py)`
  - Input integration:
    - In `pointerDown(evt)`: checks `hitZoomOutSlider()` and begins dragging.
    - In `pointerMove(evt)`: updates value while dragging.
    - In `pointerUp()`: stops dragging.
  - Rendering hookup:
    - Game loop calls `drawZoomOutSlider()` along with other UI overlays.
  - Ship scaling:
    - In `drawShip()`:
      - Base height `targetHBase = 160` pixels.
      - `targetH = Math.round(targetHBase * zoomOutSlider.value)`
      - Ship scale is clamped on the upscale side to `‚â§ 2.5√ó` native texture to preserve quality.
      - Final width/height are rounded to integers and drawn with high image smoothing quality enabled for crispness.
  - Turret scaling:
    - Turrets scale from the computed ship width/height.
    - Size is `0.175 √ó shipWidth` (i.e., 30% smaller than the original 25%).
    - Per-draw smoothing is set to high, and translation is snapped to integer pixels.

## Notes / Rationale
- We use device pixel ratio for the canvas and enable image smoothing for crisp rendering.
- We snap sprite translations and sizes to integer pixels to reduce sub-pixel blur.
- The map and world zoom were removed to avoid double-render artifacts; the slider currently affects only ship/turret size.
- If reintroducing map zoom later, use a single world transform (scale + translate) applied once per frame for all world elements to prevent misalignment and ghosting.

## How to Tweak
- Change slider bounds in `zoomOutSlider.min/max`.
- Change base ship height by adjusting `targetHBase` in `drawShip()`.
- Adjust turret ratio by modifying the factor `0.175` in `drawShip()`.
- Move the slider by editing `zoomOutSlider.x/y`.

## Future Option (Map)
- Reintroduce map zoom by computing a single `scale` and `(sx, sy)` per frame and using one canvas transform:
  - `ctx.scale(scale, scale); ctx.translate(-sx, -sy);`
  - Then draw the map and ship/turrets in world coordinates.
